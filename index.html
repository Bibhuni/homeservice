        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Within a customer app for on-demand home service, you can provide in-app messaging for the seamless answering of customer queries. This feature is much faster than the customer calling service.
            The in-app messaging feature allows the retailers and customers to understand each other in a better way. Moreover, it will reduce confusion and the possibility of errors. However, you need to make sure that your offered network is encrypted so that it can maintain the privacy of your communication.</p>
